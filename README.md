# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
In this project we are going to use different Machine Learning models in order to predict credit card risk. As credit risk is an unbalanced classifictaion problem, we will use models for unbalanced classes.

## Resources
Sci-kit learn library, Imbalanced_learn library, Pandas, Jupyter notebook, [LoanStats_2019Q1.csv.zip](/LoanStats_2019Q1.csv.zip)
